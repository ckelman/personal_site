  Made Junior year of high school, this was the first large program I wrote, and I still enjoy playing it every now and then.</p>
<p>
  It's a Java applet which can be a little unstable in web browsers
   (Chrome doesn't support Java applets, web browser must have java security settings on medium or have an exception for this site, Mac version sometimes finicky), but hopefully it works for you!  If you'd like
   to poke around the code, or get it running on your local machine, please download the code and have at it!

            alt="Your browser understands the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag but isn't running the applet, for some reason."

            Your browser is ignoring the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag!
